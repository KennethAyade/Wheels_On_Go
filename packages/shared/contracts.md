# Contracts (Placeholder)

This file documents intended API endpoints and payloads at a high level. Replace with OpenAPI specs or detailed contracts once requirements are finalized.

## Planned endpoints
- POST /auth/register
- POST /auth/login
- GET /auth/me
- GET /health

## Notes
- Request and response schemas are intentionally omitted.
- Add versioning, pagination, and error shape conventions later.
